Here is another useful article on the game loop. This one uses the SDL library, which is the same library used in the Snake game repository.

The LazyFoo SDL2 tutorial is an in-depth game programming tutorial using SDL2. There's a lot of content here, but the tutorial will walk you through everything from creating a simple window with SDL2 to using particle engines and tiling the screen with textures.
The Parallel Realities tutorials are a collection of tutorials for creating 2D shooter games (like Asteroids) and 2D platformers (like the original Super Mario Brothers) using SDL2. These are much shorter tutorials that are useful for getting your game up and running.
The TwinklebearDev SDL2 tutorials include a few simple tutorials for getting SDL2 running and displaying images to the screen.
